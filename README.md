# spam-detection-using-NLP

Spam detection filter using NLP(Natural Language Processing) and classifier includes Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVC , RandomForest

# INTRODUCTION
Today, internet and social media have become the fastest and easiest ways to get information. In this age, reviews, opinions, feedbacks, messages and recommendations have become significant source of information. Thanks to advancement in technologies, we are now able to extract meaningful information from such data using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. NLP , a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), makes use of computers and human natural language to output valuable information. NLP is commonly used in text classification task such as spam detection and sentiment analysis, text generation, language translations and document classification


# DATA SET
The dataset is from UCI datasets The file we are using contains a collection of more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages

# STEPS INCLUDED

1. Exploratory Data analysis and Data Visualization
2. Text Pre-Processing
3. Vectorization (vectorization is the process of converting text to numerical entries in a matrix form)
4. Model Training and Prediction [Naive Bayes Classifier, SVC, RandomForest, Logistic Regression]
5. Model Evaluation

# RESULT
1. Acheived 96.59% accuracy using Logistic Regression
2. Acheived 96.65% accuracy using Naive Bayes(Multinomial-NB)
3. Acheived 98.38% accuracy using Support Vector Machine
4. Acheived 97.60% accuracy using RandomnForest

# CONCLUSION
Out of all the classifier, Support Vector Machine performed well in classification of spam e-mails
