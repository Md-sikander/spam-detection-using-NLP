# INTRODUCTION
Today, internet and social media have become the fastest and easiest ways to get information. In this age, reviews, opinions, feedbacks, messages and recommendations have become significant source of information. Thanks to advancement in technologies, we are now able to extract meaningful information from such data using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. NLP , a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), makes use of computers and human natural language to output valuable information. NLP is commonly used in text classification task such as spam detection and sentiment analysis, text generation, language translations and document classification
